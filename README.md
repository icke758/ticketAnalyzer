Motivation: bad data treatment on Help Desk software.
Problem: The user does not always create the ticket on the right spot, so we need a way to see if the ticket was opened on the right place.
Solution: This POC will use deep string comparation algorithims to analyze the ticket and validate if it is indeed on the right category
